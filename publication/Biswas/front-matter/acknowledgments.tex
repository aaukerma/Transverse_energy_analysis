\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{ch:acknowledgments}
I am indebted to my advisor, Dr. Christine Nattrass, for her guidance in every aspect of the work leading to this thesis. It has been inspiring to see her balance the intensity of actively participating in a world-class research endeavor with the humility of accepting the inefficiencies involved in training novices.

I am grateful to Dr. Soren Sorensen for his constructive criticisms and for the many fruitful discussions I had with him. I would like to thank Dr. Adam Matyja for helping me troubleshoot errors in my codes and Charles Hughes for helping me get started with ROOT macros. Thanks also to Nathan Webb for helping me make my codes more understandable and to Andy Castro, Will Whitt, and Himal Acharya for the discussions pertaining to some of my codes and my thesis contents.

Finally, thanks to Chrisanne Romeo, Dr. Marianne Breinig, and Krishna Koirala for their support during a period of tough time I had prior to joining the RHIP group, to Abhishek Khanal for letting me use his spare computer, and to Spencer Beloin for not just being a workout buddy but also meeting in the weekends to learn GitHub and other computer skills.
