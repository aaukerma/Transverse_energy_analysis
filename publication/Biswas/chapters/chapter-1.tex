\section{A Brief History of the Universe}
Nobody knows what happened at the beginning of the Universe. The Big Bang model stands on the pillars of observational evidences, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the cosmological expansion, and suggests that at the beginning the universe must have been at a state of really high density and temperature. As the universe expanded, it went through several stages of cooling characterized by the formation of matters with different compositions. The matter we mostly observe today exists at temperatures and densities much lower compared to those in the early universe.

\section{Production of Historical Matter}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory have the ability to collide heavy nuclei, such as those of gold and uranium, at nearly the speed of light, reaching temperatures of trillions of degrees Celcius. These laboratories have provided evidence of the formation of an exotic state of matter, called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It only exists for a brief amount of time after such collisions and instantly freezes out into a plethora of new particles, which carry the signatures we can use to deduct QGP properties. Its properties suggest that it should be similar to the matter that existed within microseconds of the genesis of the universe. It reportedly behaves like an almost perfect quantum fluid with no resistance and exhibits other interesting properties.

\section{Motivation of This Thesis}
One of the methods to probe the properties of this matter is by analyzing the conversion of the beam-direction energy at the time of collision into transverse energy after the collision. This analysis is generally done by using data from the calorimeters placed around the collision site. In this thesis, I use the data collected by the tracking detectors, instead of the conventional calorimeters, to perform the transverse energy analysis.

\section{Organization of The Thesis}
This thesis is structured as follows. Chapter 2 touches on the theoretial background associated with the concept of the quark-gluon plasma. In Chapter 3, I attempt to summarize the experimental concepts pertaining to heavy-ion collisions, and the production and detection of QGP. Chapter 4 consists of the formalism of the measurement of transverse energy using calorimeters as well as tracking detectors. It also gives an example of what has been done using calorimeters. Chapter 4 describes the data used to perform the analysis in this thesis and notes down the details of the analysis. In Chapter 5, I present the results and compare them to the ones in literature obtained using a different method. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by summarizing it and shedding light on some of its implications.
