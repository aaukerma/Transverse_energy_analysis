\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}\label{section:QCD}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The strong force is one of the four fundamental interactions in physics. At large scale, it is responsible for binding the nucleons together to give the nucleus its structure. At the smaller scale, it binds the fundamental units of subnuclear matter, the quarks, together to form the nucleons. The electrodynamic interaction between charged particles such as protons and electrons is described by quantum electrodynamics (QED) as mediated by photons; the strong interaction, albeit more complicated, is explained under the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as mediated by gluons. \cite{KAPUSTA1979461, Shuryak1988} ???? The quarks and gluons of QCD are collectively known as partons. The gluons are the gauge bosons of the Yang-Mills theory.

The Yang-Mills theory is a non-Abelian gauge theory. It has a Lagrangian that is described by several parameters, some of which are redundant and need to be gauged. This is done by a mathematical treatment as prescribed under a gauge theory. The gauge theory associated with the Yang-Mills theory is based on the SU(N) group. It is non-Abelian as represented by the transformations being non-commutative. QCD is a gauge theory that describes the application of the SU(3) symmetry transformations on the triplet of quarks. The Electroweak interaction, on the other hand, can be formalized under the gauge group SU(2) $\cross$ U(1). Together, they form the SU(3)$\cross$SU(2)$\cross$(U1) gauge theory called the standard model.
%Along with electric charge, mass and spin, quarks have the intrinsic property of color charge. 
One of the phenomenological aspects in which QCD is different from QED is the confinement of partons. In QED, the fundamental particles are bound together by the Coulomb potential, which diminishes with distance between the charge-carrying particles, as demonstrated by the relation \ref{eqn:QED-potential}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:QED-potential}
V_{C}\propto\frac{1}{r} 
\end{equation}
where $V_{C}$ is the Coulomb potential, and $r$ is the spatial separation between the particles. This means that bound QED particles can be isolated by increasing their spatial separation. The QCD potential, on the other hand, has an extra linear term in it:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:QCD-potential}
V_{QCD} = -\frac{4}{3}\frac{\alpha_{S}}{r} + {k}{r} 
\end{equation}
%(pg 7 https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~muheim/teaching/np3/lect-qcd.pdf)
where $\alpha_{S}$ is the QCD fine-structure constant and $k$ is is the strengh of the color interaction ($~$1 GeV/fm). This means that the potential increases linearly with distance at large distances, and so an infinite amount of energy is required to separate quarks. Hence, we never observe isolated quarks and they are said to be confined, not just bound, to form composite structures called hadrons.\cite{0954-3899-32-3-R01} Composition of a quark and an anti-quark forms a meson and that of three quarks forms a baryon.

QCD is a gauge theory. Its Lagrangian remains unchanged under certain transformations. The Lagrangian has a number of degrees of freedom, some of which are redundant and need to be gauged, meaning regulated by a particular mathematical treatment. That mathematical treatment, in which the transformations of the gauge group are non-commutative, is described by a non-Abelian gauge theory. The Yang-Mills theory is an example of it. In this theory, the gauge boson is the gluon. 
%These confined, bound states of quarks and gluons is color-neutral.
%, and it is ergonomically more favorable to create a quark-antiquark pair than to produce unbound quarks
%, and $\alpha\_{QED}$ is the coupling constant.

\section{Phase Transitions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In everyday life, we observe matter existing in four distinct phases: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Changes in physical conditions can lead to a transition from one of these phases to another, exemplified by the commonly observed coversion of ice to water. Distinctions among the various phases can be represented in a chart called the phase diagram.

The phase diagram consists of thermodynamic observables such as temperature and density on its axes. Curves in the phase diagram represent boundries of physical conditions at which two or more phases of matter can coexist in equilibrium. Crossing a boundary represents an abrupt transition from one phase to another; this abruptness is mathematically characterized by the discontinuity in the change of the derivative of the free energy -- a thermodynamic varible -- with respect to the physical quantities in the axes. There can also be regions in the diagram representing the ranges of physical conditions in which a smooth phase transition can take place.

One of the main focuses of current experimental and theoretical nuclear physics research is the study of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at a range of temperatures and baryon chemical potentials. In experiments involving the collisions of heavy ions at high and low energies, different regions of the phase diagram can be probed by varying the collision energy \cite{PhysRevC.93.024901}. For instance, the high-baryon chemical potential regime corresponds to lower beam energies and higher temperatures correspond to higher beam energies. The results of these experiments and model calculations can be used to study the nature of transitions in the QCD phase diagram.

A schematic representing the QCD phase diagram on the temperature (T) and quark chemical potential ($\mu$) plane is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PhaseDiagram} \cite{1742-6596-761-1-012066}. A second-order transition is predicted at low baryon chemical potentials (close to baryon-antibaryon symmetry) and high temperatures reminiscent of the early universe. Methods to study this region of the phase space will be explored in this thesis. At low temperatures and high chemical potentials, loose predictions have been made regarding the existence of exotic phases of high density matter, and programs, such as the Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany, are being designed to study this region of the phase diagram.

\section{Quark-Gluon Plasma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The confinement of quarks into the hardonic phase of QCD matter, as described in section \ref{section:QCD}, has its limitations. At very high densities, when the wave function of a single hadron encompasses the spatial regions covered by multiple such hadrons, it is impossible to classify which pair or triplet of quarks belongs to which meson or baryon. As long as a particular quark is close enough to the other quarks in the volume, it is deconfined in such a way that it can freely move anywhere in the volume. \cite{0954-3899-32-3-R01} QCD predicts such phase transition, at energy densities above 0.2-1 GeV/fm$^{3}$ \cite{Adam:2139456} and around a critical temperature of about 200 MeV \cite{2013arXiv1304.1452M}, of strongly interacting matter to a phase with quarks and gluons in thermal and chemical equilibrium representing the relevant degrees of freedom and behaving like an almost perfect quantum fluid \cite{PhysRevLett.109.152303}. This deconfined state of quarks and gluons is termed the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in analogy to the quantum electrodynamical plasma phase of matter.

%The deconfinement is what the weakening of the strong interaction due to the polarization of the QCD vacuum is expected to lead to at high energies. The expectation of this phase transition also makes sense in terms of the chiral symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian, which is spontaneously broken at low temperatures, but restored at high temperatures, providing a sufficient condition for the deconfinement.

\section{Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions}\label{section:RHI-collisions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The experimental evidences of the theoretically appealing existence of QGP come from the collisions of large nuclei. The signatures of such evidence are described in section \ref{section:signatures}. Physicists started noting down such evidences since as far back as 1984, when nuclei were accelerated and collided with stationary targets.\cite{Gyulassy:2004vg} They were able to agree on a conclusive discovery of this matter during the 2000s, after colliding accelerated nuclei with other such nuclei or smaller species (protons, deuterons) at unprecedented energies and with improved detection schemes. \cite{Ritter:2004xj} With further increase in collision energies and enhancement in detector technololgy, modern accelerator facilities have not only added such evidences but also provided estimates of some of the properties as well as the dynamics of the evolution of the QGP. The following subsections describe two such facilities, the physics of the collisions and what happens after the collisions.

\subsection{RHIC and LHC}
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is located in Upton, New York in the premises of the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Its construction started in 1991 and was completed in 1999. Figure \ref{fig:RHIC_layout} shows the layout, at the time of construction, of the collider along with the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) complex and the locations of the original four detectors: Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR), Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX), PHOBOS and BRAHMS (Broad RAnge Hadron Magnetic Spectrometers). PHOBOS and BRAHMS were decommissioned after the completion of their science objectives, but STAR and PHENIX are still functional. The AGS was part of BNL before the construction of the RHIC, and its capabilities were augmented with the construction of the AGS Booster in 1991.
\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{Initial layout of the RHIC.\cite{doi:10.1093/ptep/ptu093}.}\label{fig:RHIC_layout}
\end{figure}

Heavy ion beams in the RHIC are created in a series of steps before collision. In case of gold ions, a pulsed sputter source produces negatively charged ions, which are stripped of some of their electrons with a foil on the positive end of the high-voltage Tandem Van de Graff. The ions are now positively charged and are accelerated to 1MeV/u toward the negative terminal of the Tandem, upon exiting which some more stripping takes place. The bending magnets then selectively deliver +32 charge states of the ions to the Booster Synchrotron, which accelerates them to 95MeV/u and strips them to +77 charge state before injecting them to the AGS. The AGS accelerates them to 10.8 GeV/u and strips them of the remaining two electrons at the exit. The gold ions are then injected through the AGS-to-RHIC Beam Transfer Line to the two RHIC rings. These rings carry beams moving in opposite directions and intersect at six symmetric locations in the 3.8 km circumference. The original four detectors are located in four of these six locations where the beams undergo head-on collisions.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is located underground (between 45m and 170m) beneath the France-Switzerland border near the city of  Geneva. The two rings of the collider were constructed between 1998 and 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the 26.7 km circular tunnel originally housing CERN's Large Electron-Positron collider. Analogous to the RHIC, the LHC gets its beams prepared by a series of machines in the CERN accelerator complex. The collisions occur at the locations of the four big LHC experiments: Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS), Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, and A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE). ALICE is dedicated to the study of heavy-ion collisions. \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}

\subsection{Collision Energy and Geometry}
What happens in the aftermath of a collision depends on how much energy is available at the time of the collision as well as the geometry of the collision. The experimenter controls the collision energy, so it's known before the collision. The geometry of the collision is deducted from the constraints imposed by the static (eg. rest mass) and dynamic (eg. trajectory) properties of the detected products.

In collision experiments, it is convenient to use a reference frame in which the net momentum of the pair of colliding species is zero. This frame is called the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy of the species in the two beams is a function of the number of nucleons and the center-of-mass energy per nucleon. In case of symmetric collisions, i.e, collisions involving identical species in the two beams, the collision energy is reported as the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The magnitude of this quantity constrains the species that can be produced from any collision.

The RHIC has the unique capability of colliding species at a range of energies spanning almost two orders of magnitude. Table \ref{table:RHIC_specs} lists the collision energies produced so far at RHIC for various collision systems. The LHC, on the other hand, boasts the highest amount of collision energy for any collider on earth. It collided species (p+p, p+A, Pb+Pb) at a center of mass energy upto 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair at the end of 2010. At the end of 2015, 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions were successfully completed. \cite{FOKA2016154}

In general, any collision between two nuclei is not perfectly head-on. Some collisions are close to being head-on and are called central collisions. Some are far from being head-on and are called peripheral collisions. The amount by which a collision is central is quantitatively represented by a variable called centrality. By convention, 0\% is the centrality of a perfectly head-on collision and 100\% is that of the least head-on, i.e., the most peripheral collision. In practice, each collision event is deducted to belong to a specific centrality bin, for instance, 0-5\%. Figure \ref{fig:mid-central_collision} illustrates the aftermath of a mid-central collision, i.e, a collision in which about half of the volume of each of the nuclei intersects the other.

\end{figure}

The collision of two nuclei can be modeled as a set of collisions of the constituents that make up the nuclei. The constituents that take part in the collisions and are called participants. The rest of the constituents are known as spectators. Figure \ref{fig:part_spec} illustrates the distribution of participants and spectators in two colliding nuclei. Expectedly, the number of participants is more in more central collisions.

\subsection{QGP Evolution}
The evolution of the QGP is shown in a lightcone diagram in figure \ref{fig:lightcone}.
The initial state of the colliding nuclei is not well known and is the topic of research for upcoming experiments. During the collision, the participants scatter off of each other while the spectators don't and keep traveling almost unperturbed in their original direction. The immediate aftermath of a central collision of heavy ions at RHIC and LHC energies is the formation of a hot fireball. This fireball evolves in time to form a liquid-like medium of quarks and gluons. This medium attains a local equilibrium and remains in such a state, depending on the collision energy, for about 1-10 fm/c. This equilibrium is broken as the liquid QGP evolves by expanding and cooling to attain a density and temperature at which the deconfinement of quarks and gluons is lost and they undergo a chemical freeze-out to form a hadron gas. Collisions between the constituents of this gas become scant as it evolves with further expansion and cooling, and the hadrons undergo a thermal freeze-out to attain their final energies and momenta.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Detection of Collision Products}\label{subsection:detection}
%%%The final state particles emit in all directions around the collision site. The symbol $\theta$ is used to denote the polar angle of the direction, i.e., the angle with respect to the beam axis, of a particle. However, it is more convenient to use a different quantity, called the rapidity, to describe the particle's direction.
Detectors are placed around the collision site to perform measurements on the final state particles emitting from the thermal freeze-out of the medium. These measurements typically include the estimation of the location and time of production of the final states, the type of particle, and the momentum and energy it carries.

Generally, a tracking detector surrounds the collision site, and there are calorimeters followed by particle identifiers around it. A magnetic field is applied parallel to the beam direction around the collision site. Due to this orientation of the magnetic field, the spectators traveling parallel to it move undeflected and the final state charged particles with components of velocity transverse to the beam axis get deflected around the beam axis with angular frequency given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:larmor}
\omega = \frac{qB}{m},
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the electric charge of the particle, $m$ is its mass and $B$ is the applied magnetic field.
Two kinds of detectors most relevant to this thesis, tracking detectors and calorimeters, are described in chapter \ref{ch:measurement}.

\section{Detection of QGP Signatures}\label{section:signatures}
http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/25/3/013/meta, and: 

The existence and properties of the QGP in the aftermath of high-energy heavy-ion collisions can be probed using different techniques relevant to several theoretical characteristics of the phase. Some of these probes are described below.

For instance, the interacting nuclei  carry no net strangeness before colliding, and so a post-collision observation of strange and multi-strange particles can be a signal for an antecedent existence of deconfined quarks and gluons \cite{1742-6596-455-1-012005}. This signal, when complemented with an observation of the enhancement of strange particles production, provides a strong hint of the formation of QGP. This can be further complemented with the estimate of the energy density and the temperature attained after the collision.

Analyses of experimental results have thus far provided signatures of the formation of matter with partonic degrees of freedom at the early stages of the collisions. Such signatures include suppression of high monentum hadrons, known as jet quenching, because the QGP is nearly opaque to colored probes, and large azimuthal anisotropies, indicating that the medium is a liquid of quarks and gluons \cite{PhysRevC.96.044904}?????. Experiments also reveal the initial energy density of this matter to be about two orders of magnitude larger than that of low energy nuclear matter -- comfortably more than the deconfinement phase transition critical density predicted by lattice QCD \cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}.

The state of the colliding nuclei before the collision at LHC and top RHIC energies has indications of being a Color Glass Condensate -- strongly interacting, weakly coupled highly coherent gluonic matter \cite{1742-6596-458-1-012024}. The characteristics of the initial states of these nuclei affect the partonic distributions within the nuclei and ultimately the products of the collision. The collision products are also affected by variables such as the initial energy and entropy densities of the partonic matter \cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}.

Different observables can be used to study different aspects of heavy ion collisions. The charged particle multiplicity, $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$, is a global variable that relates to the entropy production during the collision (analysis note). The transverse energy, $E_{T}$, a global variable related to $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$, provides information about the conversion of the initial beam-direction kinetic energy into energy flowing in the transverse direction after the collision. Together, the studies of the fluctuation of the $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$ and the $E_{T}$ pseudorapidity [footnote] density with respect to the beam energy and the collision centrality [footnote] help probe the characteristics of the initial conditions at the time of the collision. One can study, for instance, the distinctions between models based on quark participants against those based on nucleon participants [analysis note]. These quantities can also lead to the rough estimate of the initial energy density through the use of the Bjorken formula \cite{2012ARNPS..62..361M}:
%\ref{eqn:Bjorken}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Bjorken}
\epsilon \geq \frac{\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}}{\tau_{0}\pi R^{2}} = \frac{3}{2}\langle \frac{E_{T}}{N} \rangle \frac{\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}}{\tau_{0}\pi R^{2}}
\end{equation}
\
The transverse energy and the charged particle pseudorapidity densities have conventionally been calculated by using the transverse energy measurements obtained from calorimeters. This thesis details the use of particle spectra, reported as $\frac{d^{2}N}{dydp_{T}}$, from Au+Au collisions at RHIC to calculate the same global variables and serve as a method to cross check the ones involving calorimeters.

\subsection{Dilepton Production}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figures/dilepton.PNG}
  \caption{Feynman diagram representing the production of a lepton pair from a quark and an antiquark. \cite{wong1994introduction}}\label{fig:dilepton}
\end{figure}
When the color degree of freedom is liberated, a quark can interact with an antiquark to produce a virtual photon which decays into a lepton and an antilepton. This pair of leptons is devoid of a color charge and can interact with the particles in the fireball only electromagnetically. This leads to them having a significantly larger mean-free path as compared to colored probes, and the number of collision they undergo before reaching a decector is negligible. However, the thermodynamic state of the fireball affects the momenta of the quarks and the antiquarks, which in turn affect the momenta and the production rates of the lepton pairs. Specifically, the temperature of the QGP can be estimated using the dilepton spectra. The caveat of doing so is that the QGP is not the only possible source of dileptons. Hence, the contributions from other sources, mainly the Drell-Yan process, must be figured out before using the dilepton spectra as a QGP diagnostic. \cite{wong1994introduction}
% " if the quark-gluon plasma initial temperature is greater than 350 MeV, the dilepton yield from the quark-gluon plasma will be much greater than the dilepton yield from the Drell-Yan process in the region 1 GeV < M < 2.8 GeV and the observation of dileptons from the quark-gluon plasma may be possible"

\subsection{Direct photons}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{figures/directPhotons.PNG}
  \caption{Feynman diagram representing the production of photons from quarks and gluons. $(a)$ and $(b)$ represent annihilation processes, whereas $(c)$ and $(d)$ represent Compton processes.\cite{wong1994introduction}}\label{fig:directPhotons}
\end{figure}

In the QGP, a quark and an antiquark can annihilate to produce a photon and a gluon. It is also possible for the pair to annihilate and produce two photons, but the probability of this process is smaller than the former by about two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a quark (or an antiquark) can interact with a gluon to produce an antiquark (or a quark) and a photon, a process analogous to Compton scattering in QED. Just like the leptons described in the previous section, the photons produced in the QGP can only interact with the medium electromagnetically. Therefore, they undergo minimal scattering before being detected, and hence can be used to probe the thermodynamical state of the medium at the time of their creation.\cite{wong1994introduction} Photons can also be produced after hadronization as a result of the scattering of the hadrons within the evolved medium. However, the nature of the $p_{T}$ distribution is different in this case, and this difference helps distinguish these photons from the direct photons produced by partonic interactions.\cite{Wilde:2012wc}
