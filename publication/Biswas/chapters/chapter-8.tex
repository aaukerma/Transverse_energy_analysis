\section{Asymmetric beams}
The codes in the repository can be used to analyze more data. In fact, since there is more data available on collisions of asymmetric systems such as d+Au?, we can expect it to be a test to tell if the assumptions? used in this analysis scale to such domains?

\section{Goodness of Fit}
A maximum likelihood fit method can be adopted to compare the results with those using the chi-squared fits.
