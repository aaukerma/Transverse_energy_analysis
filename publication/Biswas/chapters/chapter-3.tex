\section{Definition of Transverse Energy}
In theory, $E_{T}$ from a collision can be defined as the sum of the transverse masses, $m_{T}$, of all the particles produced in the collision, i.e.,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ETDefTheory}
E_{T}\equiv\sum_{i}m_{T,i}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mT}
m_{T}\equiv\sqrt{p_{T}^{2}+m^2}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the rest mass of the particle and $p_{T}$ is its transverse momentum. Using this definition to calculate the $E_{T}$ requires perfect identification of all the particles. It has not been possible to do so in experiments, and so a more feasible, operational definition of $E_{T}$ is fabricated. A commonly accepted definition in case of the feasibility of calorimetric measurements is \cite{PhysRevC.89.044905, PhysRevLett.109.152303}:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ETDefSum}
E_{T} = \sum_{i}E_{i}\sin{\theta_{i}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dETdEta}
\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}=\sin{\theta}\frac{dE}{d\eta},
\end{equation}

where the index $i$ runs over all the particles going into a fixed solid angle for each event, $\theta$ is the polar angle, i.e, the angle with respect to the beam axis, $\eta$ is the pseudorapidity defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pseudorap}
\eta\equiv-\ln\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}},
\end{equation}
and $E_{i}$ is the energy deposited in the calorimeter by the $i^{th}$ particle. $E_{i}$ is considered to be, by convention \cite{PhysRevC.71.034908}, the following
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:EiCaseByCase}
E_{i} = 
	\begin{cases}
	E_{i}^{tot}-m_{0} & \text{for baryons} \\
	E_{i}^{tot}+m_{0} & \text{for anti-baryons} \\	
	E_{i}^{tot} & \text{otherwise} \\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%\ $E_{i}^{tot}$ - $m_{N}$ in case of baryons, $E_{i}^{tot}$ + $m_{N}$ in case of antibaryons, and the $E_{i}^{tot}$ in case of other particles, 
where $E_{i}^{tot}$ is the total energy of the $i^{th}$ particle defined canonically as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Etot}
E^{tot}\equiv\sqrt{p^{2}+m_{0}^2}
\end{equation}
and  $m_{0}$ is the particle's rest mass.
In order to account for the portion of the emitted transverse energy not detected or overestimated by the calorimeters, corrections are made based on GEANT simulations.

\section{$E_{T}$ Measurement with Calorimeters}

\section{$E_{T}$ Measurement with Tracking Detectors}
Transverse energy analysis can be done using tracking detectors as well if they are able to produce measurements of other physical quantities that implicitly contain information about the transverse energy. Specifically, the charged particle multiplicity distributions with respect to the transverse momenta can be used to calculate the particle's transverse energy pseudorapidity density. In fact, since the corrections related to the tracking detectors are very different from those related to the calorimeters, results from the two different methods can be used to test the assumptions involved in each.

The tracking detectors in experiments such as the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC) experiment and ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at CERN include Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors that can give us the $p_{T}$ spectra, yields and particle ratios of the identified charged hadrons \cite{Preghenella:2011vy, PhysRevC.96.044904}. The TPCs provide measurements of particle trajectories -- that can be used to determine the momenta for low-momentum particles -- and of their specific energy loss, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:specificEnLoss}
	\frac{dE}{dx} ,
\end{equation}
which can be used with the trajectories to make particle identifications (PID) using the Bethe-Bloch formula \cite{bethe1953passage}. TOF detectors, on the other hand, cover the high-momentum part of the measurements. In ALICE, the combination of the measurements of the TPC with those of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) effectively adds the tracking length, thereby improving the resolution of the measured $p_{T}$ spectrum. Details about the PID and momentum determination capabilities of the detectors in ALICE can be found in \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08002}.

The $p_{T}$ spectra, available as the counts $\frac{d^{2}N}{dydp_{T}}$ with respect to $p_{T}$, can be used to calculate $\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}$ as formulated in the following section.

\subsection{Calculation of $\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}$ from $p_{T}$ spectra}
In relativistic heavy ion collisions, rapidity ($y$) is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rapidity}
y\equiv\frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{E + p_{z}}{E - p_{z}}},
\end{equation}
where $E$ is given by equation \ref{eqn:Etot} and $p_{z}$ is the component of the momentum parallel to the beam axis.
Pseudorapidity, $\eta$, is just $y$ with $m_{0} = 0$:
\begin{align*}\label{derivation:pseudorapidity}
\eta &= \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{p + p_{z}}{p - p_{z}}}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{1 + \cos{\theta}}{1 - \cos{\theta}}}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{2\cos^2{\frac{\theta}{2}}}{2\sin^2{\frac{\theta}{2}}}}
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pseudorapidity}
\therefore \eta = -\ln{\left|{\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}}\right|}
\end{equation}
Note that the absolute value is not necessary for $0 \leq \theta  \leq \pi$. Then, taking the exponential of both sides of the above equation and using Euler's formula, we get:
\begin{equation}
\sin\theta = \frac{1}{\cosh\eta}.
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{align*}
p &= \frac{p_{T}}{\sin\theta}\\
&= p_{T}\cosh\eta,
\end{align*}
and so we have
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ET-as-pTOverJacobian}
E_{T} = E\sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{p_{T}^2\cosh^2\eta+m_{0}^2}}{\cosh\eta} 
\end{equation}

The Jacobian for the transformation from $y$-space to $\eta$-space is derived, by differentiating $y$ with respect to $\eta$ (obtained form equations \ref{eqn:rapidity} and \ref{eqn:pseudorapidity}), to be:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Jacobian}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \eta} = \frac{p_{T}\cosh\eta}{\sqrt{m_{0}^2+p_{T}^2\cosh^2\eta}}
\end{equation}

From equations \ref{eqn:ET-as-pTOverJacobian} and \ref{eqn:Jacobian}, we can see that the product of $E_{T}$ with the Jacobian is equal to $p_{T}$. That leads to a formulation of $\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}$ as a function of only $\eta$ and $p_{T}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dETOverdEta}
\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta} = \frac{1}{2a}\int_{0}^{10GeV/c}\int_{-a}^{a} p_{T}\frac{d^{2}N}{dydp_{T}} \,d\eta\,dp_{T}
\end{equation}
where $a$ and $-a$ are the bounds for $\eta$.


\subsection{Tracking Detectors in STAR}\label{subsec:tracking_STAR}
In the STAR experiment, the TPC is the primary tracking detector. It is 4.2 m long and it cylindrically enshrouds the accelerator beam pipe from its outside, with an inner diameter of 1 m and an outer diameter of 4 m \cite{phdthesisnattrass}. It covers a pseudorapidity range of $|y|$ $<$ 1.8 in all of azimuth in terms of acceptance of charged particles. It can identify particles with momenta over 100 MeV/c up to about 1 GeV/c as well as measure their momenta from 100 MeV/c to 30 GeV/c \cite{Anderson:2003ur}. Figure \ref{fig:STAR_PID} shows the PID capability of the STAR TPC for very high-multiplicity events \cite{0034-4885-73-11-116201}. Separation of pions from protons is demonstrated up to a little more than 1 GeV/c. At higher momenta, separating particles is more difficult because their energy loss has lower dependence on the rest mass \cite{Anderson:2003ur}. The TOF system in STAR, with a time resolution of $\lessapprox$ 100 ps, aids PID at higher momenta. However, at intermediate $p_{T}$, between $\approx$ 2.0 and 4.0 GeV/c, the TPC by itself cannot distinguish between pions and protons and the TOF by itself cannot separate pions from kaons. This problem is resolved by utilizing the fact that the dependence of the particle velocity on $p_{T}$ -- in case of the TPC -- is different from that of the energy loss on $p_{T}$ in case of the TPC; combining the results from the two, hence, makes PID feasible in this $p_{T}$ range. \cite{Shao:2005iu}

\section{The Beam Energy Scan Program}
The RHIC, in 2010, started a multi-phase Beam Energy Scan (BES) program to study the QCD phase diagram. The collider has the unique facility to collide nulclei at a range of center-of-mass energies per nucleon, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. It also has two different detectors that are currently operational, STAR and PHENIX (Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interactions eXperiment), which facilitate the cross-checking of results. Between 2010 and 2011, under the exploratory phase I of the BES program, 7.7, 11.5 (not completed in PHENIX), 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV collisions were completed using pairs of Au nuclei. Together with the data formerly collected by the RHIC at higher collision energies, BES phase I data can scan the interval from 450 MeV to 20 MeV in $\mu_{B}$ space \cite{1742-6596-455-1-012037, LUO201675}. One of the things that can be studied with the data associated with this region of the phase space is statedly the possibility of a ``turn-off of new phenomena already established at higher RHIC energies" (https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/starnotes/public/sn0493). Results corresponding to the high-$\mu_{B}$ region might provide evidence of a first order phase transition, and possibly the critical point \cite{LUO201675}.

The manifestation of such phenomena would be in terms of the fluctuations in the properties of the post-collision system. One can, for instance, study the scaling of the transverse energy after the collision with the longidutional energy at the time of the collision, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. This can be done in multiple ways for a detector like STAR or PHENIX that is made up of sub-systems such as the TOF detectors, TPCs/Time Expansion Chambers, as well as calorimeters. 

\subsection{BES Calorimetry}
\citet{PhysRevC.93.024901} use calorimetry in PHENIX to analyze the transverse energy corresponding to several different pairs of species colliding at a range of energies. They use the raw transverse energy measured by the EMCal, $E_{{T}EMC}$, to obtain the total hadronic $E_{T}$ by making corrections in three different steps. They first scale the data by a constant factor calculated to account for the fiducial acceptance in azimuth and pseudorapidity. The second factor is calculated to adjust for the effects of the calorimeter towers that are disabled. The third factor, $k$, is computed as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:AdareKfactor}
k = k_{response} \times k_{inflow} \times k_{losses}
\end{equation}
where $k_{response}$ corresponds to hadronic particles only depositing a fraction of their total energy while passing through the EMCal, $k_{inflow}$ is attributable to the energy deposited by particles coming from outside the EMCal's fiducial aperture, and $k_{losses}$ accounts for the energy not registered in the EMCal due to energy thresholds, edge effects, and more importantly due to the particles that make it into the fiducial aperture but decay into products outside the aperture.

\subsection{BES $p_{T}$ spectra}
This thesis details the method of transverse energy analysis through the use of $p_{T}$ spectra from the STAR BES data. As described in section \ref{subsec:tracking_STAR}, the TPCs and TOF detectors in STAR can identify particles as well as their trajectories and ultimately their multiplicity distributions with respect to the momenta. \citet{PhysRevC.96.044904} report the results for the $p_{T}$ spectra for six different identified hadrons, $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $K^+$, $K^-$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$, from the STAR experiment. The spectra come from Au+Au collisions -- at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, and 39 GeV in the year 2010 and at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 and 27 GeV in 2011 -- under the BES Program. Figure \ref{fig:BESPaper_pTSpectra} \cite{PhysRevC.96.044904} shows the spectra corresponding to 39 GeV collisions categorized into seven different collision centralitiy classes. These spectra, and their counterparts for the rest of the energies, were used to calculate an estimate of the total transverse energy per event per particle species. This result was then used to estimate the total transverse energy due to all the collision products.
