%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The experimental evidences of the theoretically appealing existence of QGP come from the collisions of large nuclei. The signatures of such evidence are described in section \ref{section:signatures}. Physicists started noting down such evidences since as far back as 1984, when nuclei were accelerated and collided with stationary targets.\cite{Gyulassy:2004vg} They were able to agree on a conclusive discovery of this matter during the 2000s, after colliding accelerated nuclei with other such nuclei or smaller species (protons, deuterons) at unprecedented energies and with improved detection schemes.\cite{Ritter:2004xj} With further increase in collision energies and enhancement in detector technololgy, modern accelerator facilities have not only added such evidences but also provided estimates of some of the properties as well as the dynamics of the evolution of the QGP. The following sections describe two such facilities, the physics of the collisions and what happens after the collisions.

\section{RHIC and LHC}
The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is located in Upton, New York in the premises of the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Its construction started in 1991 and was completed in 1999. Figure \ref{fig:RHIC_layout} shows the layout, at the time of construction, of the collider along with the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) complex and the locations of the original four detectors: Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR), Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment (PHENIX), PHOBOS and BRAHMS (Broad RAnge Hadron Magnetic Spectrometers). PHOBOS and BRAHMS were decommissioned after the completion of their science objectives, but STAR and PHENIX are still functional. The AGS was part of BNL before the construction of the RHIC, and its capabilities were augmented with the construction of the AGS Booster in 1991.

  \caption{Initial layout of the RHIC.\cite{doi:10.1093/ptep/ptu093}.}\label{fig:RHIC_layout}
\end{figure}

Heavy ion beams in the RHIC are created in a series of steps before collision. In case of gold ions, a pulsed sputter source produces negatively charged ions, which are stripped of some of their electrons with a foil on the positive end of the high-voltage Tandem Van de Graff. The ions are now positively charged and are accelerated to 1MeV/u toward the negative terminal of the Tandem, upon exiting which some more stripping takes place. The bending magnets then selectively deliver +32 charge states of the ions to the Booster Synchrotron, which accelerates them to 95MeV/u and strips them to +77 charge state before injecting them to the AGS. The AGS accelerates them to 10.8 GeV/u and strips them of the remaining two electrons at the exit. The gold ions are then injected through the AGS-to-RHIC Beam Transfer Line to the two RHIC rings. These rings carry beams moving in opposite directions and intersect at six symmetric locations in the 3.8 km circumference. The original four detectors are located in four of these six locations where the beams undergo head-on collisions.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is located underground (between 45m and 170m) beneath the France-Switzerland border near the city of  Geneva. The two rings of the collider were constructed between 1998 and 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the 26.7 km circular tunnel originally housing CERN's Large Electron-Positron collider. Analogous to the RHIC, the LHC gets its beams prepared by a series of machines in the CERN accelerator complex. The collisions occur at the locations of the four big LHC experiments: Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS (ATLAS), Large Hadron Collider beauty (LHCb) experiment, and A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE). ALICE is dedicated to the study of heavy-ion collisions. \cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}

\section{Collision Energy and Geometry}
What happens in the aftermath of a collision depends on how much energy is available at the time of the collision as well as the geometry of the collision. The experimenter controls the collision energy, so it's known before the collision. The geometry of the collision is deducted from the constraints imposed by the static (eg. rest mass) and dynamic (eg. trajectory) properties of the detected products.

In collision experiments, it is convenient to use a reference frame in which the net momentum of the pair of colliding species is zero. This frame is called the center-of-mass frame. In this frame, the total energy of the species in the two beams is a function of the number of nucleons and the center-of-mass energy per nucleon. In case of symmetric collisions, i.e, collisions involving identical species in the two beams, the collision energy is reported as the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The magnitude of this quantity constrains the species that can be produced from any collision.

The RHIC has the unique capability of colliding species at a range of energies spanning almost two orders of magnitude. Table \ref{table:RHIC_specs} lists the collision energies produced so far at RHIC for various collision systems. The LHC, on the other hand, boasts the highest amount of collision energy for any collider on earth. It collided species (p+p, p+A, Pb+Pb) at a center of mass energy upto 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair at the end of 2010. At the end of 2015, 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions were successfully completed. \cite{FOKA2016154}

In general, any collision between two nuclei is not perfectly head-on. Some collisions are close to being head-on and are called central collisions. Some are far from being head-on and are called peripheral collisions. The amount by which a collision is central is quantitatively represented by a variable called centrality. By convention, 0\% is the centrality of a perfectly head-on collision and 100\% is that of the least head-on, i.e., the most peripheral collision. In practice, each collision event is deducted to belong to a specific centrality bin, for instance, 0-5\%. Figure \ref{fig:mid-central_collision} illustrates the aftermath of a mid-central collision, i.e, a collision in which about half of the volume of each of the nuclei intersects the other.
	\begin{figure}[h]

	\end{figure}

The collision of two nuclei can be modeled as a set of collisions of the constituents that make up the nuclei. The constituents that take part in the collisions and are called participants. The rest of the constituents are known as spectators. Figure \ref{fig:part_spec} illustrates the distribution of participants and spectators in two colliding nuclei. Expectedly, the number of participants is more in more central collisions.

The apparent narrowing of the volumes of the nuclei in the z-direction is due to Lorentz contraction. \cite{PhysRevC.90.044907}}\label{fig:part_spec}
\end{figure}



\section{Kinematic Variables}
The description of the collision physics and the interpretation of its results are aided by the construction of variables that undergo simple transformations under a change of reference frame. Two such variables, rapidity and pseudorapidity, are described in this section.

The rapidity, $y$, of a particle is defined as:

	\begin{align}\label{def:rapidity}
	y &\equiv \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{p_{0} + p_{z}}{p_{0} - p_{z}}}\\
	&= \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{E + p_{z}}{E - p_{z}}},
	\end{align}
where $p_{0}$ and $p_{z}$ are the components of its contravariant four-momentum $p = (p_{0}, p_{x}, p_{y} p_{z})$ with $p_{0} = \frac{E}{c}$, $E$ being the relativistic energy of the particle and $c$, the speed of light, being equal to $1$ in natural units.

The rapidity of a particle is used as a relativistic description of its velocity. Unlike the canonical velocity of a particle, its rapidity transforms simply additively under a Lorentz boost of the frame of reference. For example, suppose a particle has a rapidity $y$ in a laboratory frame. Let $y'$ denote its rapidity as measured in a frame that is Lorentz boosted with a velocity $\beta$ in the $z$-direction with respect to the laboratory frame. Then the relationship between the rapidities in the two different frames is simply
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rapidityTransformation}
	y' = y - y_{\beta}
	\end{equation}
Here,
	\begin{equation}
	y_{\beta} = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
	\end{equation}
is the rapidity the particle would have in the laboratory frame if it were moving with a velocity $\beta$ in the $z$-direction with respect to the laboratory frame, as can be verified from equation \ref{def:rapidity} with $p_{0} = \gamma m$ and $p_{z} = \gamma \beta m$, $\gamma$ being the Lorentz factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}$.\cite{wong1994introduction}

The convenience provided by this construct comes with a cost. As evident from equation \ref{def:rapidity}, the calculation of the rapidity of a particle requires the measurement of two different observables associated with it, such as the energy and the $z$-direction momentum. However, experimental constraints may sometimes only facilitate the measurement of the direction of the detected particle with respect to the beam axis. What's more convenient in such a case is the use of another variable construct called pseudorapidity, $\eta$, defined as:
	\begin{equation}\label{def:pseudorapidity}
	\eta \equiv -\ln{\tan{\frac{\theta}{2}}},
	\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the angle the particle's momentum vector, \textit{\textbf{p}}, makes with the $z$-direction. The above equation can also be written in terms of the momentum as:	
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pseudorapidity2}
	\eta = \frac{1}{2}\ln{\frac{\left|{\textit{\textbf{p}}}\right| + p_{z}}{\left|{\textit{\textbf{p}}}\right|- p_{z}}}
	\end{equation}
From equations \ref{def:rapidity} and \ref{eqn:pseudorapidity2}, it is evident that $\eta \approx y$ when $\left|{\textit{\textbf{p}}}\right| \approx p_{0}$, i.e., when the momentum is large. The transformation of the particle distribution from the $y$-space to the $\eta$-space is discussed in section \ref{section:calcFromSpectra}.

\section{QGP Evolution}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{figures/LightCone1_color-crop_NThesis.pdf}
  \caption{Evolution of the QGP represented in a lightcone diagram. $\tau_{0}$ denotes the formation time of the QGP. $T_{c}$ is the critical temperature of the transition from the QGP to the hadron gas phase. $T_{ch}$ and $T_{fo}$ stand for the temperatures at, respectively, chemical freeze-out and thermal freeze-out. \cite{Connors:2017ptx}}\label{fig:lightcone}
\end{figure}
The evolution of the QGP is shown in a lightcone diagram in figure \ref{fig:lightcone}.
The initial state of the colliding nuclei is not well known and is the topic of research for upcoming experiments. During the collision, the participants scatter off of each other while the spectators don't and keep traveling almost unperturbed in their original direction. The immediate aftermath of a central collision of heavy ions at RHIC and LHC energies is the formation of a hot fireball. This fireball evolves in time to form a liquid-like medium of quarks and gluons. This medium attains a local equilibrium and remains in such a state, depending on the collision energy, for about 1-10 fm/c. This equilibrium is broken as the liquid QGP evolves by expanding and cooling to attain a density and temperature at which the deconfinement of quarks and gluons is lost and they undergo a chemical freeze-out to form a hadron gas. Collisions between the constituents of this gas become scant as it evolves with further expansion and cooling, and the hadrons undergo a thermal freeze-out to attain their final energies and momenta.

\section{Detection of Collision Products}\label{subsection:detection}
%%%The final state particles emit in all directions around the collision site. The symbol $\theta$ is used to denote the polar angle of the direction, i.e., the angle with respect to the beam axis, of a particle. However, it is more convenient to use a different quantity, called the rapidity, to describe the particle's direction.
Detectors are placed around the collision site to perform measurements on the final state particles emitting from the thermal freeze-out of the medium. These measurements typically include the estimation of the location and time of production of the final states, the type of particle, and the momentum and energy it carries.

Generally, a tracking detector surrounds the collision site, and there are calorimeters followed by particle identifiers around it. A magnetic field is applied parallel to the beam direction around the collision site. Due to this orientation of the magnetic field, the spectators traveling parallel to it move undeflected and the final state charged particles with components of velocity transverse to the beam axis get deflected around the beam axis with angular frequency given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:larmor}
\omega = \frac{qB}{m},
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the electric charge of the particle, $m$ is its mass and $B$ is the applied magnetic field.
Two kinds of detectors most relevant to this thesis, tracking detectors and calorimeters, are described in chapter \ref{ch:measurement}.

\section{Detection of QGP Signatures}\label{section:signatures}
%http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/25/3/013/meta, and: 

The existence and properties of the QGP in the aftermath of high-energy heavy-ion collisions can be probed using different techniques relevant to several theoretical characteristics of the phase. No such signature can alone be used to claim the production of the QGP, and some of the probes, which should be interpreted together, are described below.


%Analyses of experimental results have thus far provided signatures of the formation of matter with partonic degrees of freedom at the early stages of the collisions. Such signatures include suppression of high monentum hadrons, known as jet quenching, because the QGP is nearly opaque to colored probes, and large azimuthal anisotropies, indicating that the medium is a liquid of quarks and gluons \cite{PhysRevC.96.044904}?????. %Experiments also reveal the initial energy density of this matter to be about two orders of magnitude larger than that of low energy nuclear matter -- comfortably more than the deconfinement phase transition critical density predicted by lattice QCD \cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}.

%The state of the colliding nuclei before the collision at LHC and top RHIC energies has indications of being a Color Glass Condensate -- strongly interacting, weakly coupled highly coherent gluonic matter \cite{1742-6596-458-1-012024}. The characteristics of the initial states of these nuclei affect the partonic distributions within the nuclei and ultimately the products of the collision. The collision products are also affected by variables such as the initial energy and entropy densities of the partonic matter \cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}.

%Different observables can be used to study different aspects of heavy ion collisions. The charged particle multiplicity, $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$, is a global variable that relates to the entropy production during the collision (analysis note). The transverse energy, $E_{T}$, a global variable related to $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$, provides information about the conversion of the initial beam-direction kinetic energy into energy flowing in the transverse direction after the collision. Together, the studies of the fluctuation of the $\langle N_{ch} \rangle$ and the $E_{T}$ pseudorapidity [footnote] density with respect to the beam energy and the collision centrality [footnote] help probe the characteristics of the initial conditions at the time of the collision. One can study, for instance, the distinctions between models based on quark participants against those based on nucleon participants [analysis note]. These quantities can also lead to the rough estimate of the initial energy density through the use of the Bjorken formula \cite{2012ARNPS..62..361M}:
%\ref{eqn:Bjorken}
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Bjorken}
%\epsilon \geq \frac{\frac{dE_{T}}{d\eta}}{\tau_{0}\pi R^{2}} = \frac{3}{2}\langle \frac{E_{T}}{N} \rangle \frac{\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}}{\tau_{0}\pi R^{2}}
%\end{equation}
%The transverse energy and the charged particle pseudorapidity densities have conventionally been calculated by using the transverse energy measurements obtained from calorimeters. This thesis details the use of particle spectra, reported as $\frac{d^{2}N}{dydp_{T}}$, from Au+Au collisions at RHIC to calculate the same global variables and serve as a method to cross check the ones involving calorimeters.
\subsection{Bjorken Energy Density}
%mostly pg 271 to 275 in \cite{Wilde:2012wc}
In 1983, J.D. Bjorken\cite{PhysRevD.27.140} prescribed a formula to use the final state particles to estimate the initial energy density, $\epsilon_{0}$, in a nucleus-nucleus collision. With slight changes in the original formula, the energy density is given by:
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bjorken}
	\epsilon_{0} = \frac{1}{\tau_{0}A_{T}}\langle\frac{dE{T}}{dy}\rangle,
	\end{equation}
where $\tau{0}$ is the proper time at the moment of QGP equilibration, $A_{T}$ is the transverse area of the intersection of the two nuclei, and $\langle\frac{dE{T}}{dy}\rangle$ is the mean transverse energy per unit rapidity. $\tau_{0}$ is model-dependent and is normally of the order of $~1 fm$. $A_{T}$ depends on the centrality of the collision. $\langle\frac{dE{T}}{dy}\rangle$ is found from the measurement of the transverse energy carried by the final state particles from the collision and is the central theme of this thesis. Details about it are in the following chapters.
The estimate of the initial energy density from Bjorken formula can be compared with the QCD prediction of the critical energy density\cite{Adam:2139456} to check if the results from a collision imply the achievement of the critical physical condition required for the phase transition.\cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}
%Experiments reveal it to be about two orders of magnitude larger than that of low energy nuclear matter -- comfortably more than the deconfinement phase transition critical density predicted by lattice QCD \cite{2005PrPNP..54..443J}.

\subsection{Elliptic Flow}
For yet unknown reasons, the evolution of the medium produced after relativistic heavy ion collisions can be well desribed under the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics. \cite{SCHENKE2017105,2014NuPhA.926...92S} This description indicates the presence of a collective flow, and hence a liquid-like and thermalized nature, of the constituents that make up the system. The momentum distribution of the final state particles emitting out of the collectively flowing system can be decomposed into its azimuthal Fourier components. The second harmonic coefficient, $\nu_{2}(y,p_{T})$, of this decomposition characterizes what is known as the ellipltic flow.\cite{2001PhLB..503...58H} The magnitude of the elliptic flow from a non-central collision represents the anisotropy in azimuthal momentum space of the thermalized post-collision system.\cite{2011NJPh...13e5008S}
%In normal matter, the speed of sound is generally more in solid than in liquid and more in liquid than in gas. This is because it its proportional to the ......
The elliptic flow of the medium, as a function of the momentum or the kinetic energy in the transverse direction, points towards quarks, rather than hadrons, being the relevant degrees of freedom in the QGP. Figure \ref{fig:v2Scaling1} shows $v_{2}$ plotted against the transverse momentum and the transverse kinetic energy for identified particles. The spectra scale consistently at lower values of both $p_{T}$ and $KE_{T}$. However, they branch out at higher values: $p_{T} \gtrsim 2 GeV/c and KE_{T} \gtrsim 1 GeV$. Figure \ref{fig:v2Scaling2}, on the other hand, is similar to figure \ref{fig:v2Scaling1}, with the exception that both the axes have quantities that are normalized by the number of quarks, $n_{q}$. In this case, the $KE_{T}$ spectra strongly exhibits ($p_{T}$ does so less strongly) a scaling which is more comprehensively consistent with the number of quarks than in case of figure \ref{fig:v2Scaling1}. This universal quark-number scaling can be interpreted as the degrees of freedom of the system being quark-like.\cite{2007PhRvL..98p2301A}

\subsection{Dilepton Production}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figures/dilepton.PNG}
  \caption{Feynman diagram representing the production of a lepton pair from a quark and an antiquark. \cite{wong1994introduction}}\label{fig:dilepton}
\end{figure}
When the color degree of freedom is liberated in the post-collision system, a quark can interact with an antiquark to produce a virtual photon which decays into a lepton and an antilepton. This pair of leptons is devoid of a color charge and can interact with the particles in the fireball only electromagnetically. This leads to them having a significantly larger mean-free path as compared to colored probes, and the number of collision they undergo before reaching a decector is negligible. However, the thermodynamic state of the fireball affects the momenta of the quarks and the antiquarks, which in turn affect the momenta and the production rates of the lepton pairs. Specifically, the temperature of the QGP can be estimated using the dilepton spectra. The caveat of doing so is that the QGP is not the only possible source of dileptons. Hence, the contributions from other sources, mainly the Drell-Yan process, must be figured out before using the dilepton spectra as a QGP diagnostic. \cite{wong1994introduction}
% " if the quark-gluon plasma initial temperature is greater than 350 MeV, the dilepton yield from the quark-gluon plasma will be much greater than the dilepton yield from the Drell-Yan process in the region 1 GeV < M < 2.8 GeV and the observation of dileptons from the quark-gluon plasma may be possible"

\subsection{Direct photons}
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{figures/directPhotons.PNG}
  \caption{Feynman diagram representing the production of photons from quarks and gluons. $(a)$ and $(b)$ represent annihilation processes, whereas $(c)$ and $(d)$ represent Compton processes.\cite{wong1994introduction}}\label{fig:directPhotons}
\end{figure}

In the QGP, a quark and an antiquark can annihilate to produce a photon and a gluon. It is also possible for the pair to annihilate and produce two photons, but the probability of this process is smaller than the former by about two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a quark (or an antiquark) can interact with a gluon to produce an antiquark (or a quark) and a photon, a process analogous to Compton scattering in QED. Just like the leptons described in the previous section, the photons produced in the QGP can only interact with the medium electromagnetically. Therefore, they undergo minimal scattering before being detected, and hence can be used to probe the thermodynamical state of the medium at the time of their creation.\cite{wong1994introduction} Photons can also be produced after hadronization as a result of the scattering of the hadrons within the evolved medium. However, the nature of the $p_{T}$ distribution is different in this case, and this difference helps distinguish these photons from the direct photons produced by partonic interactions.\cite{Wilde:2012wc}

\subsection{Strangeness Enhancement}
% http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/37674/11/11_chapter%202.pdf
The interacting nuclei carry no net strangeness before colliding, and so a post-collision observation of strange and multi-strange particles can be a signal for an antecedent existence of deconfined quarks and gluons \cite{1742-6596-455-1-012005}. Strangeness can also be produced in hadron-hadron collisions. However, it is enhanced in nucleus-nucleus collisions in which a large number of hadrons are produced and are in chemical equilibrium at very high temperatures. Consider the ratio of the production of the strange kaons to that of the non-strange pions, which are the most abundant hadrons produced from nucleus-nucleus collisions. Kaon yield increases more rapidly than does pion yield as the temperature increases. This can be shown mathematically by treating the system as a hadron gas in thermal and chemical equilibrium that follows the Bose-Einstein distribution, but it is beyond the scope of this thesis.\cite{wong1994introduction}

\subsection{Jet Quenching}
A scattering event in which the participants transfer a large amount of their original momenta is called hard scattering. The products of the scattering, carrying high transverse momenta in opposite directions, are called jets. In heavy-ion collisions, most of the hard scatterings are the results of two partons from the opposite nuclei scattering off of each other. These partons can lose their momenta by strongly interacting with a medium made of deconfined quarks and gluons. Therefore, the properties of the jets, as carried by the final state hadrons, should be different for collisions that produce the QGP as compared to those that don't, and hence they can be used as signatures and probes of QGP. Figure \ref{fig:jets} illustrates the quenching of jets that have to travel long distances in the medium. %Details about the forms of interaction of the hard partons with the QGP is beyond the scope of this thesis. 
Formalisms developed to study jet quenching due to radiative and collisional energy losses are detailed in \cite{2015IJMPE..2430014Q}.

	  \centering
	  \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figures/jets.PNG}
	  \caption{Illustration of jet quenching. Two jets are produced from each of the hard scatterings occuring at the locations of the solid dots. Jets originating closer to the initial surface are more probable to propagate outside the medium, as shown. Jets opposite to them interact with the medium, losing their energy and resulting in bow front shock waves.\cite{STOCKER2005121}}\label{fig:jets}
	\end{figure}
%The interaction of the jets in the QGP medium can be in the form of gluon bremsstrahlung or parton collision.

\section{The Beam Energy Scan Program}
The RHIC, in 2010, started a multi-phase Beam Energy Scan (BES) program to study the QCD phase diagram. The collider has two different detectors that are currently operational, STAR and PHENIX, which facilitate the cross-checking of results. Between 2010 and 2011, under the exploratory phase I of the BES program, 7.7, 11.5 (not completed in PHENIX), 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV collisions were completed using pairs of Au nuclei. Together with the data formerly collected by the RHIC at higher collision energies, BES phase I data can scan the interval from 450 MeV to 20 MeV in $\mu_{B}$ space \cite{1742-6596-455-1-012037, LUO201675}. One of the things that can be studied with the data associated with this region of the phase space is statedly the possibility of a ``turn-off of new phenomena already established at higher RHIC energies" (https://drupal.star.bnl.gov/STAR/starnotes/public/sn0493). Results corresponding to the high-$\mu_{B}$ region might provide evidence of a first order phase transition, and possibly the critical point \cite{LUO201675}.

The manifestation of such phenomena would be in terms of the fluctuations in the properties of the post-collision system. One can, for instance, study the scaling of the transverse energy after the collision with the longidutional energy at the time of the collision, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. This can be done in multiple ways for a detector like STAR or PHENIX that is made up of sub-systems such as the TOF detectors, TPCs/Time Expansion Chambers, as well as calorimeters. The next chapter gives an example of the measurement of transverse energy using BES data from PHENIX calorimeters. Also, the next chapter and the ones after it contain the procedures and the results of the analysis of the BES data from STAR using the identified particles spectra.
