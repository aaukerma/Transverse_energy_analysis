RUNNING PYTHIA6 FOR ANALYZING TRANSVERSE ENERGY PER COLLISION ENERGY:
================================================================================
There are two ways to run the program,

1) if you wish to run a single event:
      (a)   open PythiaStartUpRoot.C in an editor and modify the inputs to your
      specifications (see below)

      (b)   while open to the directory containing the file dependencies, run:

          root PythiaStartUpRoot.C

      (c)   You can either close root with .q or you can run another event with
      the line:

          makeEventSample(EVN,ID,TUNE,SNN,CUT,YNCUT,DTYPE,DMODE)

       where each of the inputs are as described below (see below). Resulting
       files are of the form: "pp[ID]_[SNN]GeV[type].[ext]" where [type] is the
       output file type and [ext] is either .txt or .root
       (ID and SNN  are described below)

2) to run a full analysis across 10 energies:
      (a)   open PythiaFullRunRoot.C in an editor and modify the inputs to your
      specifications (see below)

      (b)   Run the program with the following command:

          root PythiaFullRunRoot.C

      (c)   The run is now complete. Resulting files are of the form:
      "pp[ID]_[SNN]GeV[type].[ext]" where type is the output file type and
      ext is either .txt or .root (ID and SNN  are described below)
================================================================================

RUNNING PYTHIA8 ANGANTYR FOR ANALYZING TRANSVERSE ENERGY PER COLLISION ENERGY:
================================================================================
To run Angantyr:

        (a)   open AngantyrStartUpRoot.C in an editor and modify the inputs to
        your specifications and be sure to specify which angantyr to run
        (see below)

        (b)   Run the program with the following command:

            root AngantyrStartUpRoot.C

        (c)   The run is now complete. Resulting files are of the form:
        "pA[ID]_[SNN]GeV[type].[ext]" where type is the output file type and
        ext is either .txt or .root (ID and SNN  are described below)
================================================================================

RUNNING ANALYSIS:
================================================================================
To run the analysis:

        (a)   Ensure all 10 SNN have been run for a given ID
        (b)   Run the program with the following command:

            root RunAnalysisR.C

        (c)   The program will prompt you with the ID (see below) and version.
              The ID should match the files.
                  ex: pp20190815_7GeVoutfile.root
                  ID is 20190815
              The version will be asked via "pp or pA?". Input 'p' for pp and
              'A' for pA.
                  ex: pp20190815_7GeVoutfile.root
                  pp or pA? is 'p'
        (d)   The analysis will result with 6 graphs. Any that end with the
              string "FROMTXT" are from the .txt files and are universal numbers
              meaning that the ET is a total over all events. The other plots
              are based on histograms filled in each event.
================================================================================

Specifications and Run Parameters:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of parameters that can be modified to run Pythia in the
desired manner:

(1)   ENV   [modifies the number of events to be run]
(2)   ID    [Changes the ID of the job preferred method is the date as YYYYMMDD]
(3)   TUNE  [PYTHIA6 ONLY Default is 350 changes tuning]
(4)   SNN   [Collision Energy choose from list in xxStartUpRoot.C Program]
(5)   CUT   [type of cut: 'y' for rapidity cut and 'n' for pseudorapidity cut]
(6)   YNCUT [Range of above cut]
(7)   DTYPE [Detector type, chooses to either measure the ET equally  with 'c'
             or to measure ET with consideration for baryons 'r' which is
             defined as
                ET=Etot-m0    for baryons
                ET=Etot+m0    for antibaryons
                ET=Etot       for mesons and other
             and Etot is described as:
                Etot=sqrt(p^2+(m0)^2)]
(8)   DMODE [This refers to the counting method. There are four main counting
             modes:
                'a'
                'b'
                'c'
                'd' [DEFAULT]
             where mode 'a' counts all particles giving an over estimation with
             pletny of double counting. mode 'b' gives an under estimation and
             only includes final state particles. mode 'c' is a unique method of
             counting that was designed to include decays. mode 'c' is a work in
             progress and should not be used unless modified. mode 'd' is the
             default and has no double counting. the method of counting for each
             mode is described in detail at the bottom of this README.
(9)    For Angantyr, there are two programs that can be run:
          Angantyr_3.C
          Angantyr_4.C
       Both are essentially the same, however, Angantyr_3.C includes an extra
       output file that shows the full decay modes of the eta and omega mesons
       to ensure that the tune is functioning properly.
(10)   HIGHEVN  [number of events for LHC energies 2760GeV and 5020GeV as they
                tend to take longer to run. It is recommended that his value is
                lower than EVN]

Tuning:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pythia6 is running the Perugia 2011 tune*
Pythia8 Angantyr is running the MONASH 2013 tune*
