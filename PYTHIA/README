To run most up to date version of PYTHIA for RHIP group:

open directory containing:
  PYTHIALoop2.C
  PythiaStartUpRoot.C
  PythiaFullRunRoot.C
  RunAnalysis.C

There are two ways to run the program,
1) if you wish to run a single event, then simply run:
      root PythiaStartUpRoot.C
      makeEventSample(Number_of_Events,custom_ID,350,Collision Energy)
2) to run a full analysis across 15 energies:
      open PythiaFullRunRoot.C in an editor,
      modify EVN to equal number of events for lower energies and HIGHEVN for higher energies (1TeV+)
      set ID to custom ID
   then simply run:
      root PythiaFullRunRoot.C
   when the collisions are complete, it will prompt the ID you had set.
   type in the custom ID you had choosen and press enter.
   the graphs analyzing the assumptions made about neutral particles will be returned
