fitBESData_main.cpp

fits BES Data with BGBW function to extrapolate and finds the total transverse energy* for a given transverse momentum distribution produced from Au+Au collisions at 5 different energies 7.7, ..., ..., ..., 39 GeV, measured at 9 different centralities [0,8] for identified particles of 6 types pi-, pi+, k-, k+, proton and antiproton.

* per unit rapidity and pseudorapidity; also finds particle multiplicity per unit rapidity and pseudorapidity for different classes of particles


5*9*6 = 270 different histograms


Classes (except the ones that already exist):
