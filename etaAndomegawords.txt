Eta:
The [eta] contribution was determined via transverse mass scaling using the data
 from [1]. The data from Au+Au at central collisions, Au+Au at semi-central
 collisions, Au+Au at peripheral collisions, d+Au with minimum bias [6], and p+p [6]
 collisions were used. An interpolation was made for each of these data sets
 using the fit function:
 y=exp(a-b/x)
 which is the best guess for the fit of the pythia v6.131 results given in the
 transverse mass paper[7]
 A scale function was then created from these results by taking the average fit
 for each corresponding [pi0] momentum bin.

 [
 pT=vect1[i][j].Dat.pTl;                //pt from pi0 ptspectra for given bin
 for (int k=0;k<5;k++){
   parameter= p0[k]-(p1[k]/pT);         //finds scale of eta to pi0 for each data set
   s0[k]=exp(parameter);
 }
 scale=(s0[0]+s0[1]+s0[2]+s0[3]+s0[4])/5;  //takes average across all fits to make average scale
 ]

 after finding the scale factor for each individual bin, the eta spectra was
 extrapolated from the pi0 spectra bin for bin using the scale function.

Omega:
  this was calculated in exactly the same manner as [eta] save that the data was
  collected for several [omega] decay modes (w->e+,e-;w->pi+,pi-,pi0;w->pi0,gamma;
  w->pi+,pi-,pi0 PRC75; w->pi0,gamma PRC75)[2][3] as well as the ISR(p+p at SNN=62.4GeV)[4]
  and E706 (pi- + Be at SNN=31GeV)[5]. In the same manner an interpolation for each
  data set was created and then a scale function was applied to extrapolate for
  the omega ptSpectra

Results:
  It was found that the eta to pi0 pt spectra ratio was on average around .4 while
  the omega to pi0 pt spectra was around .8 with large uncertainty. This means that
  the ET contribution based on PT spectra from omega is rouhgly double that of eta
